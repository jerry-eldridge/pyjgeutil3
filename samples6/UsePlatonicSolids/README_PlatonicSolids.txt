Note that the models cube1.obj, dodecahedron1.obj,
icosahedron1.obj, octahedron1.obj, and tetrahedron1.obj
are created by 5_use_platonic_solids.py and should
not be written to as 5_use_platonic_solids.py will
create those .obj 3D models (simplicial complexes).

The 3D models Alias Wavefront .obj files can be
viewed in a number of different 3D model viewer software.
Microsoft has "3D Viewer" or "3D Builder". There is
also the free Blender software and NVIDIA has its
Omniverse Composer for NVIDIA GPU RTX cards and others.
There are also ways to convert a .obj file to a .vrml
file and use a VRML viewer like view3dscene but
the quality is not as great as using a ray tracer.
NVIDIA GPU RTX cards can ray trace in real time with
Omniverse Composer and Blender will render most of
the scenes in 1 or 2 seconds on a RTX card (etc).
There is also the commercial software Autodesk Maya.
Etc.
