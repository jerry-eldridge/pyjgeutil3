    <pre>Another Homotopy on an Algebraic Expression using lerp

A homotopy is a string that is one shape at time t = 0 of f(x) where
the string is another shape at time t = 1 of g(x).

A homotopy H(x,t) is a map such that H(x,0) = f(x) and H(x,1) = g(x)
such that the parameter t = 0 is f and t = 1 is g. That is,
H : X x [0,1] -&gt; Y.

Previous essay mentioned the expression a*a*b as {a:2,b:1} being
morphed into expression a as {a:1,b:0}.

So in this essay, we present an even simpler morphing or homotopy between
the algebraic expressions.

In Python3 IDLE,

import numpy as np
e = lambda n,m: f"a**{n}*b**{m}"
e = lambda x,y: f"a**{x}*b**{y}"
lerp = lambda A,B,t: list(map(float,list(np.array(A)*(1-t)+np.array(B)*t)))
tmin = 0
tmax = 1
N = 10
dt = (tmax-tmin)/N

t = tmin
while t &lt; tmax:
    x = lerp([2],[1], t)[0]
    y = lerp([1],[0], t)[0]
    expr = e(x,y)
    print(f"{t}: {expr}")
    t = t + dt

where note our implementation of lerp required us to at least have
a list of numbers and since we use just one we need [2] instead of 2.
Also lerp returns a list of numbers and so we need x = lerp(x0,x1,t)[0]
and y = lerp(y0,y1,t)[0] where x0 = [2] and x1 = [1], and y0 = [1]
and y1 = [0] and where x is x(t) and y is y(t).

0: a**2.0*b**1.0
0.1: a**1.9000000000000001*b**0.9
0.2: a**1.8*b**0.8
0.30000000000000004: a**1.7*b**0.7
0.4: a**1.6*b**0.6
0.5: a**1.5*b**0.5
0.6: a**1.4*b**0.4
0.7: a**1.3*b**0.30000000000000004
0.7999999999999999: a**1.2000000000000002*b**0.20000000000000007
0.8999999999999999: a**1.1*b**0.10000000000000009
0.9999999999999999: a**1.0*b**1.1102230246251565e-16

where the above shows f"{t}, {expression}" for parameter t and
algebraic expression a**x(t) * b**y(t) such that x(0) = 2
and y(0) = 1 and x(1) = 1 and y(1) = 0 morphing a**2 * b**1 into
a**1 * b**0 or a*a*b into a.

So in this essay and the previous one, we have a smooth transformation
from one algebraic expression to another one. In Biology, the previous
essay using ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) is usually preferred.
