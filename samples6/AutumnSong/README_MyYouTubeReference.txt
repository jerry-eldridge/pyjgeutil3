The song "jerry_dances_to_autumn_in_paradise.txt" was
improvised on the piano to create an audio track of
a 3D model animation I created with Blender. I used
Meshy AI using a photo of me to create "Jerry Body 01"
and I painted the model in Blender > Texture Paint 
and rigged the model but not very well. The model's
'skin' or geometry that is was soft across the character
when it animated. However, this was my first rigged
model in Blender and I also wanted an audio track.

After, I transcribed the improvised song and and the
video with audio is:

and the transcription is jerry_dances_to_autumn_in_paradise.txt
which 2_play_song.py replicates the piano playing in an
arbitrary musical instrument timbre provided the coefficients
for the harmonics amplitudes.
