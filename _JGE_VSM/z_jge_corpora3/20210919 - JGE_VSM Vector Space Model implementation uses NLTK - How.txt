20210919 - JGE_VSM Vector Space Model implementation uses NLTK - How to Install NLTK

Recently, I mentioned how I long ago installed python3 and libraries:

"""
The last script 8 is text only and displays a graph of memory usage
for a large quadtree and plots with matplotlib python3 library.

where long ago, I did this:

cmd> cd c:\_Python38-64-tf\
cmd> .\python -m pip install opencv-python
cmd> .\python -m pip install matplotlib

to install.

The previous essays today on 20210919 (9/19/2021) on
"20210919 - Multiple Queries with JGE_VSM - Python - Output", J. G. Eldridge,
Personal Communications, 9/19/2021 mentioned the indexer.py in a
_JGE_VSM.zip (8 KB) zip file. That indexer.py uses the NLTK library which
is imported "import nltk". Specifically, to tokenize essays and natural
language. In Python3, do if not already done before:

  >>> import nltk
  >>> nltk.download()

and to install the nltk to be able to "import nltk" one does
"pip install nltk" so for me this is in the Windows cmd shell:

cmd> cd C:\_Python38-64-tf\
cmd> .\python -m pip install nltk

The JGE_VSM script like indexer.py may or not work after "pip install nltk"
above. But if not, then one does in python "import nltk" and "nltk.download()"
and downloads the usual nltk corporas.
