20210919 - Summary - Information Retrieval and Language Models and Exploration

The previous essay on "20210919 - QuadTree - YouTube - Google Scholar and
Quadtree Image Compression" was a summary of the last few days on Quadtrees.

We might be able to summarize that essay and the previous few days with:
"Information Retrieval and Language Models and Exploration".

Suppose we have a graph G = (V,E) of vertices v in V and edges pairs of
vertices (u,v) in E. A path is a sequence v1,v2,...,vn of vertices.

But models for languages are grammars describing syntax and meanings describing
semantics. Understanding is knowing syntax and semantics. A phrase or word
in the language is a sequence of tokens from the alphabet of that language.
The previous paragraph had the concept of a path which was also just a sequence
of tokens vertices in that example.

A model for information retrieval is the "vector space model".

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model

for searching with a query of a smaller amount of words in a natural language

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)

for describing a sequence of vertices in a graph

[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form
Backus-Naur form

for describing a language of words or phrases which are sequences of symbols
in an alphabet.

[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

for describing abstract machines and natural language and general languages:

For example, search engines like Google Search, YouTube, and Google Scholar:

[6] https://www.google.com/
[7] https://www.youtube.com/
[8] https://scholar.google.com/

implement search of text information retrieval systems much like the
vector space model [1]. Words from the language written are searched in the
search engine based on query and documents are retrieved based on distance
between query and document.

[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space
Metric space, the concept of a distance function d(x,y)
[10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)
The set B(x,r) = {y: d(x,y) < r} for example. Ball (mathematics)

or listing the closest k documents y to query x.

That is, we have some way of describing language, understanding a language
of syntax and semantics. We might look at a word and expand that word based
on semantics.

How do we describe semantics? One way by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED)
is to write example concordances of a phrase in an language:

[11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)
concordance
[12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(publishing)

where we mean more sense [12] which is "a concordance is an alphabetical
list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every
instance of each word with its immediate context".

Another way is the American Heritage Dictionary which mentions definitions
or rephrasing in terms of other words the meaning of a word.

In BNF (Backus-Naur Form), a token is described by a rule of a left hand
side LHS and a right hand side RHS where the LHS can be replaced by the
RHS. For example S := NP VP where a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb
phrase. And VP := V NP and a verb phrase is a verb and a noun phrase as
two possible rules in a simple grammar for natural language English.
The NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) expands upon the concept.

Parsing a grammar, or exploring a graph G with paths of vertices, are
ways of Exploration. In Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control by Bertsekas,
models for decision making were mentioned. At any state there might
be several possible decisions to a next state that could explored like
a chess player trying to decide on a chess move decision in a given chess
board position state to explore a game tree.

The main concluding concept is that once generating a language or a path
of symbols from an alphabet that of using a search engine to get more
words. One starts with a query word or phrase and then they find top
documents in a language.

A model of the search or user is that of a machine or an animal with a brain
and nervous system. Neuroscience explains the nervous system. Artificial
Intelligence tries to model animal and human intelligence. Examples are
computer vision trying to implement the animal visual system.
