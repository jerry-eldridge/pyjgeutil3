20210919 - Multiple Queries with JGE_VSM - Python - Output

Attached again is _JGE_VSM.zip (8 KB) containing
3_Search_VectorSpace.py. Also if changing the index,
one can remove the pickle .p files in the Z_Pickles folder
and re-run the indexer with 0_Index_First.py . Doing
that rebuilds the index.

====================== 3_Search_VectorSpace.py
import sys
sys.path.insert(0,r"C:\_JGE_VSM")
import indexer as idxr

def Query(query,k=10):
     idxr.Search(query, idxr.index, idxr.L, k)
     return

def Search():
     done = False
     while not done:
         print("type 'quit' to quit.")
         query = input("query> ")
         if query == "quit":
             done = True
             break
         else:
             try:
                 Query(query, k = 3)
             except:
                 continue
     return

Search()
#Query("physics",k=3)
============================

implements a multi-search loop. Type "quit" to exit loop. Or one could
use the first script 1_ . The try-except lines make it display no error
when searching for a word out of the dimensions.

I think I said last time there were about 75 words but only about 45 of them
are unique. Actually, hence the dimensions of query and documents are
then 45-dimensional. When using "algebra" as a word, it does not occur
in the vocabulary and hence it is not a valid dimension. So when the
scripts encounter that word it complains of an error. Try different things.
I do not know if "physics algebra" is an error.

A while back, I read about University Physics. It mentioned
mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, modern
physics, and quantum mechanics.

A while back, I read about University Physics. It mentioned

type 'quit' to quit.
query> quit
>>> 
=======================

If you contain a word not in vocabulary like "algebra", it just exits.
Instead one needs to replace all non-vocabulary words with "" by pre-processing
the query. That way query would be a valid vector in the vector space.

query> electricity algebra

where I modified _JGE_VSM.zip so that a query containing "algebra" just
removes "algebra" from the query if it is not in the vocabulary of the essays.
That is, "algebra" does not occur in the essays. The query "electricity algebra"
is replaced by "electricity" in this instance. But once one adds an essay
mentioning "algebra" word, after indexing with 0_ script, it will also be
part of the vocabulary.
