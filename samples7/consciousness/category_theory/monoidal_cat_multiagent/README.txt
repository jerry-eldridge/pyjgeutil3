This is experimental code relating to Category Theory
and Monoidal Category to build an agent with operations.
Then a program of operations (morphisms) is done.
However, parallel processing is limited as seen
by the buggy software 18_BOSS_BUSY_LAZY_BUGGY.py but
if limiting to a star topology 19_Star_Topology.py
then parallel processing between a BOSS (center of star)
and WORKERS (spokes of the star) functions.
