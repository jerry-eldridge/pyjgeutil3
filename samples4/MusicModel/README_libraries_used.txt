The required libraries are numpy, scipy, nltk,
and midiutil.

In windows, the Windows Media Player could be used
to play MIDI .mid files. There might be delays in playing
the file before or after however.

In Windows Media Player, the best way to listen to .mid
files is to create a PlayList with model1-001.mid,
model2-001.mid, model3-001.mid, model4-001.mid, etc, 
and save it, and click on Playlists, optionally clicking
the repeat button on play.
