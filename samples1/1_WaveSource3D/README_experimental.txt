The WaveSource3D elevation grid is experimental. As is, the
input image "wavesource-b.jpg" perhaps should be n x n in width
and height. Or perhaps the image should be smoothed or blurred
so the elevation grid is not too coarse.

You create an image with 1_WaveSource3D.py creating wavesource-b.jpg
a grayscale map and convert that to elevation grid with
2_GrayScaleToElevationGrid.py. A snapshot of the result 
WaveSource3D-snapshot.jpg shows the .obj file opened with
3D Viewer from a recent builtin Microsoft Update.
