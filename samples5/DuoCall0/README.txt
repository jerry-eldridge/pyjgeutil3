DuoCall0 is experimental switch simulator. This is for
modeling interconnection networks using graph theory
and graphs of vertices and edges.

The basic component is n inputs and m outputs and an
internal graph data variable inside it. Then for an
input a[1] and output b[0] it finds the path between 1 
and 0.

Currently the design of the class objects is being developed.
